# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java. The goal is to learn and practice fundamental concepts of computer science.

## Progress

### Linked Lists
- **Singly Linked List**
  - Insertion at the beginning, end, and specific positions.
  - Deletion from the beginning, end, and specific positions.
  - Searching for elements.
  - Reversing the list.
  - Checking if the list is empty.
  - Displaying the list.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the internal workings of data structures.
- Implement algorithms with efficiency in mind.
- Practice problem-solving skills using Java.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired data structure or algorithm.
3. Run the Java files to test the implementations.

## Future Plans
- Add doubly linked lists.
- Implement stacks and queues.
- Explore tree and graph algorithms.
- Solve problems using dynamic programming and greedy algorithms.
