/**
 * The BubbleSort class demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm.
 * Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list,
 * compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
 * 
 * Fun Fact: It's called "Bubble Sort" because the smaller elements "bubble" to the top
 * (or front) of the array, just like bubbles in water!

     * - If no swaps are made, the array is already sorted, and we can exit early.
