 * üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è CycleSort Class üö¥‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
 * 
 * This class demonstrates the Cycle Sort algorithm, which is an in-place sorting algorithm.
 * It places each element at its correct position in the array by cycling through the elements.
 * 
 * Fun Fact: Cycle Sort minimizes the number of writes to the array, making it efficient for scenarios
 * where minimizing memory writes is important! üß†

     * How it works:
     * - Each element is placed at its correct position in the array.
     * - If an element is not in its correct position, it is swapped with the element at its target position.
     * - This process continues until all elements are in their correct positions.
     * 
     * Note: This algorithm assumes that the array contains integers in the range [1, n], where n is the size of the array.
