/*
 & What is recursion?
 * -> 
 ? Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It is often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub problems. A recursive function typically has two main components:

    *1. Base Case: The condition under whi2ch the recursion stops. Without a base case, the function would call itself indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow.

    *2. Recursive Case: The part of the function where it calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the problem.

         * Explanation of recursion in Fibonacci:
         * - The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
         * F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
         * F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1
         * - For example, fibo(4) will call fibo(3) and fibo(2).
         * fibo(3) will call fibo(2) and fibo(1).
         * fibo(2) will call fibo(1) and fibo(0).
         * - The recursion stops when it reaches the base case (n < 2).
         * - Once the base cases are reached, the results are returned and summed up:
         * fibo(2) = fibo(1) + fibo(0) = 1 + 0 = 1
         * fibo(3) = fibo(2) + fibo(1) = 1 + 1 = 2
         * fibo(4) = fibo(3) + fibo(2) = 2 + 1 = 3
